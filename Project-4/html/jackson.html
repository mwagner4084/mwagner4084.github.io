		  <h1>Hey there, ladies.</h1>
		  <h3>Is it warm in here, or are you just in heat?</h3>
		  <p>I'm only looking for a little tail, if you know what I mean. Nothing serious. I don't like having another mammal around to compete with for attention from the humans. I am a Boston Terrier mixed with a Beagle, so naturally I'm very intelligent. I, unfortunately, share a birthday with Hitler, making my zodiac sign a Taurus. Do with that information what you will. I am excellent at scrounging through the trash for scraps and sniffing out each square foot of the home for crumbs. I am a frequent napper, and I do not appreciate interruptions of any kind. I do tend to overindulge in licking, but that could work out in your favor. I'm a big cuddler and have the amazing talent of fitting myself into anywhere I please, so even if the humans say there "isn't room" for me, once I'm in there, I'm rarely told to leave. If you're looking to lounge around, eat, and cuddle all day, I'm your dog.</p>

				What I lack in stature, I make up for in strength. My bite is strong and my growl is mean. I have lost very few matches of Tug of War, and most of those I was wrongfully cheated out of. Don't let my competitive demeanor fool you, though. I am not what you would call a "tough" or "protective" dog, so if that's what you're looking for, prepare to be disappointed.
