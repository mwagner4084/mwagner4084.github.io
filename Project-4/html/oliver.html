		  <h1>Hello, Females.</h1>
		  <h3>You must be my backyard 'cause I might dig you.</h3>
		  <p>I'm a lovable Golden Retriever/Rottweiler mix with a medium build. I'm a nature enthusiast and spend much of my free time with my family. My grandpa is starting to get older, so I like to escort him on evening walks around the neighborhood. I have a lot of energy, so it's hard for him to keep up sometimes. I'd love to find a lady doggo who can match my energy. I enjoy chasing squirrels, rabbits, and deer, but I sometimes get too excited and lose all self-control and find myself in some sticky situations, so I need a companion who can keep me in check when I need it so that I don't end up chasing a pack of deer into a busy highway again. Sometimes I like to play pranks on my grandpa and pull his bath towel on the floor while he's not looking. He doesn't think it's very funny, but I keep doing it anyway. We could formulate various "partner in crime" pranks to pull on the humans together over Mom's leftover steak dinner. She always shares when Dad's not looking. I don't like loud noises or sharing attention. If you're into bad boys, keep looking because I am the goodest boy.</p>
